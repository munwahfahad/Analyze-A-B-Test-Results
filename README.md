# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

# Introduction:

A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an A/B test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

# Tools:

- Python

- Numpy

- Pandas

- Matplotlib

- Scipy

- Jupyter Notebook

# Conclusion:

After the investgation, it seems that ther is almost equal chance of converting users between the old and the new pages. I reccommend the company to keep the old pages to save money.
